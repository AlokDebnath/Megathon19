* The Company 
About the company: Data company, person does not know maufacturing.
Hadoop knowledge also not present. They have fabrication centers.

1. The Lady 
2. Man #1 
3 Man #2
* Questions
** Is this related to their company or is it general manufacturing   
** Architecture oriented or not? 
*** If archi => Projo Jojo => No code, Arch Diags

.
** Solutions to use with the data, or do you already have use
* Idea 
** Still the same 
Idea: Logging
** How to store the data? 
Come from where, how it is stored .Is this related to their company or is it general manufacturing  
res and why it is stored? 

We need to be aware of how we store our data. Structured v. unstructured
data

Data access is something that we need to talk about. Store productive
data only.

** Presentation Tasks 
1. Dataset
2. UI mock up
3. Personalized data summary
4. Efficiency: Hadoop is good for a particular task, wheras other data
   can be structured in a different way.
5. Data preprocessing
6. Rule mining: Apriori, BIRCH, methods to get the rulesets more
   efficiently
7. Intelligent Text Retrieval: To be mentioned
8. Secure ;)

* Presentation 
** Unstructured Data: Not being used 
** Text Aspects: Gathering, Storing 
Distributed across Data centres, draw the arch diagram. 
** Data now accessed.
How and why 
** BE AWARE OF THE STORAGE 
** Why this is efficient, make a case for it 
* Other ideas
** Data Pre-processing 
1. Apriori, BIRCH 
2. Association Rule mining 
* Things  
1. Architecture, Information Retrieval Techniques
