# Megathon19
Private Repo for Megathon 2019.
Problem Statement: Something about using information retrieval in the
world of the manufacturing.

Idea: Logging

About the company: Data company, person does not know maufacturing.
Hadoop knowledge also not present. They have fabrication centers.

Questions: Manufacturing to their company or in general?
           Solutions to use with the data, or do you already have use
cases?

We need to be aware of how we store our data. Structured v. unstructured
data

Data access is something that we need to talk about. Store productive
data only.


What are we building?
Steps that we are sticking with.
1. Dataset
2. UI mock up
3. Personalized data summary
4. Efficiency: Hadoop is good for a particular task, wheras other data
   can be structured in a different way.
5. Data preprocessing
6. Rule mining: Apriori, BIRCH, methods to get the rulesets more
   efficiently
7. Intelligent Text Retrieval: To be mentioned
8. Secure ;)
